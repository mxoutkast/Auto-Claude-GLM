# Build Progress: New Multi Providers (006)

## Status: Phase 1 Complete

## Summary

This spec was flagged with CRITICAL issues by the Spec Critic Agent due to:
1. **Research/Spec Mismatch**: The research.json contained information about graphiti-core multi-provider support, but the spec.md incorrectly described adding multi-provider support to the Auto Claude agent framework (which uses claude_code_sdk).
2. **Technical Infeasibility**: The claude_code_sdk cannot be replaced with OpenAI/Gemini APIs as it provides unique agent SDK capabilities.

## Resolution

Upon investigation, the multi-provider functionality described in research.json was **already implemented** as part of spec 002 (Memory System V2):

### Existing Implementation
- `auto-claude/graphiti_config.py` - Multi-provider configuration (OpenAI, Anthropic, Azure OpenAI, Ollama, Voyage AI)
- `auto-claude/graphiti_memory.py` - Memory integration using the provider factory
- `auto-claude/graphiti_providers.py` - Factory pattern for LLM clients and embedders

### Work Completed (Phase 1)
Added comprehensive unit tests for multi-provider functionality:
- 36 tests covering all provider configurations
- Tests for: OpenAI, Anthropic, Azure OpenAI, Ollama LLM providers
- Tests for: OpenAI, Voyage AI, Azure OpenAI, Ollama embedder providers
- Tests for validation errors, provider summary, available providers
- Tests for GraphitiState serialization and error handling

### Test Results
```
36 passed in 0.49s
```

## Recommendations

Since the multi-provider system is already implemented, the remaining phases of this spec are either:
1. **Not needed** - The implementation already exists
2. **Duplicate** - This work was completed in spec 002

Consider closing this spec as "duplicate/already implemented" and referencing spec 002 for multi-provider documentation.
